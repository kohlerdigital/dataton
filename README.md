> "Because who doesn't want to help design a train system in a country with more horses than train tracks?"

## 🎯 Our Vision

We're tackling the challenge of optimising Borgarlínan's route by analyzing high-value datasets to ensure it actually goes where people need it to go (revolutionary concept, we know). Our solution aims to balance accessibility, environmental impact, and practical considerations - because apparently, trains can't fly over mountains (yet).

## 🔍 Project Approach

### Data Integration
We're working with four primary datasets:
- Geographic data (making sure we don't accidentally route the train through someone's living room)
- Population distribution from Hagstofan (finding out where humans actually exist)
- Employment centers (because people need to get to work)
- Proposed routes (the ones we're either validating or completely redesigning)
- Stræto bus routes (Or what they have)
